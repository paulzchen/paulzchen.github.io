## About Me
Welcome to my academic website! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Chemical Engineering & Applied Chemistry at the [University of Toronto](https://chem-eng.utoronto.ca/), where I've been fortunate to be an [NSERC Vanier Scholar](https://vanier.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html), a [Junior Fellow of Massey College](https://www.masseycollege.ca/), and advised by [Prof. Frank X. Gu](https://chem-eng.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/faculty-members/frank-gu/). Previously, I conducted research at the University of Waterloo, [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/), and [Brigham & Women’s Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/), and received a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in 2016. I have a multidisciplinary background, leading work in nanoscience, materials science, physical chemistry, chemical engineering, biomedical engineering, mathematical modelling, and infectious disease epidemiology. 

Outside of the lab, I currently mentor students, serve as Co-chair of [Massey Grand Rounds](https://www.masseycollege.ca/massey-grand-rounds/), and lead [“I Am… A Scientist”](https://twitter.com/UofTSR/status/1388138602354421760?s=20), a new science outreach initiative for kids. Previously, I was involved in several other science outreach, mentorship, and leadership activities. 

## My Research
In early March 2020, I pivoted to help with the response to COVID-19. Our work has helped to understand why superspreading drives the COVID-19 pandemic but not the H1N1 pandemic (overdispersion in transmissibility is associated with broad case heterogeneity in respiratory viral load); model the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 is expelled via droplets and aerosols; find that high, persistent shedding in the lower respiratory tract characterizes, and may predict, severe COVID-19 in adults; show that disease severity, rather than sex or age, predicts SARS-CoV-2 kinetics; and assess methods to decontaminate N95 masks for reuse. Our findings support the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our work indicates that virological factors foremost mediate overdispersion. That is, poorly ventilated, crowded spaces with susceptible individuals facilitate superspreading, but whether a virus tends to transmit via large clusters in the first place is intrinsic to that viral infection.

In my thesis research, I investigate the nanoscale thermodynamics and atomic kinetics of nanocrystal growth and use that insight to develop methodologies to design nanomaterials. We have formulated theoretical equations and the accompanying experimental methodology to characterize the supersaturation dynamics underlying the growth of colloidal nanocrystals. This approach enables the prediction of growth profiles, and identification of supersaturation-associated shape evolutions, of nanocrystals, providing insight for their rational design. We are pursuing additional studies to better understand nanocrystal growth and expand the range of achievable nanocrystals. Through an industial collaboration, we are also applying our nanomaterials to develop biomedical technologies. More to come!

My long-term interests are to broadly understand how atoms and molecules form complex materials, how structure leads to properties, and how to efficiently design materials that address key issues. Ultimately, I hope my work helps to improve both science and society.
