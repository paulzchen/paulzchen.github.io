## About Me
Welcome to my personal website! I'm a PhD student in the Department of Chemical Engineering & Applied Chemistry at the [University of Toronto](https://chem-eng.utoronto.ca/), where I've been fortunate to be an [NSERC Vanier Scholar](https://vanier.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html), a [Junior Fellow of Massey College](https://www.masseycollege.ca/), and advised by [Prof. Frank X. Gu](https://chem-eng.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/faculty-members/frank-gu/). Previously, I conducted research at the University of Waterloo, [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/), and [Brigham & Women’s Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/), and received a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in 2016. I have a multidisciplinary background, leading work in nanoscience, materials science, physical chemistry, chemical engineering, biomedical engineering, mathematical modelling, and infectious disease epidemiology. 

Outside of the lab, I currently mentor students, serve as the Head of Programming for [Science Rendezvous at the University of Toronto](http://www.sciencerendezvousuoft.ca/science-rendezvous/), serve as Co-chair of [Massey Grand Rounds](https://www.masseycollege.ca/massey-grand-rounds/), and lead [“I Am… A Scientist”](https://twitter.com/UofTSR/status/1388138602354421760?s=20), a new multi-platform science outreach initiative for kids. 

## My Research
In early March 2020, I pivoted to help with the response to COVID-19. We have primarily focused on investigating the respiratory kinetics and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Our work has helped to understand why superspreading drives the COVID-19 pandemic but not the last pandemic (broader case variation in respiratory viral load); model the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 is expelled via respiratory droplets and aerosols; find that high, persistent shedding in the lower respiratory tract characterizes, and may predict, severe COVID-19 in adults; show that disease severity, rather than sex or age (including for children), predicts SARS-CoV-2 kinetics; and assess methods to decontaminate N95 masks for reuse. Our findings support the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, aiding its growing acceptance. We also developed a framework to show that the tendency to transmit via superspreading is largely an intrinsic characteristic of a virus and its host interactions. 

In my thesis research, I investigate the nanoscale thermodynamics and atomic kinetics of nanocrystal growth and use that insight to develop methodologies to design nanomaterials. We formulated theoretical equations and an experimental methodology to characterize supersaturation dynamics _in situ_ throughout the growth of colloidal nanocrystals, which is providing insight into their growth mechanisms. Through an industial collaboration, we are also applying our nanomaterials to develop biomedical technologies. 

My long-term interests are to broadly understand how atoms and molecules form materials, how structure leads to properties, and how to efficiently design materials that address key health, energy or environmental issues. Overall, I hope my work helps to improve both science and society.
